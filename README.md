# movieCards
A React Front end for my movieLibraryAPI(Java Spring)

The included file, sql-movie_api.txt, holds the data I used while building. 
I would reccomend running it through mySQL for the full experience. 
Otherwise it will be very boring of a site.

The postman collection will allow you to seed you own data, of course.
